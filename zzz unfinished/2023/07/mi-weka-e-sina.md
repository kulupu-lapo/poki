title: "mi weka e sina" (toki pona cover of "Je t'en remets au vent" by Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine)
description: |
  This is more an adaptation of "Je t'en remets au vent" than a pure translation. I tried to keep the general meaning, but as he's a very poetic author, a lot has been lost to translation.
  
  Special thanks to Esteban for his emotional support, photography skills, and various advice
