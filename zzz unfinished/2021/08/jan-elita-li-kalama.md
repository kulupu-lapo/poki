title: jan Elita li kalama (Toki Pona song about Elijah McClain's tragic death)
description: |
  Elijah McClain, a 23 year-old massage therapist and community volunteer, was walking home on August 24, 2019 after buying an iced tea for his brother. Due to his anemia, he was wearing a ski mask. Officers received a call saying that McClain was being suspicious. They grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground. Supposedly the body cams of three officers fell into the grass. They placed him in a carotid hold, meant to cut circulation off to the brain (the practice was banned in 1990). When medics arrived, they administered a "therapeutic" dose of ketamine, leading McClain to go into cardiac arrest. On August 30, he was taken off life support.
