title: nanpa mi ("It's my birthday", a toki pona song)
description: |
  Notes about wording:
  
  "nanpa mi li kama suli" literally means "my number (my age) gets big", but could also mean "my score increases", a positive counterpoint to the negativity in the verses. "nanpa mi" is the toki pona title, and "It's my birthday" is the English title,  not a full translation. I might record an English version in the future, maybe with slightly reworded lyrics...
  
  "mi tawa ma" could be "I'm going towards the ground",  it evokes death nearing.
  
  "mi wan ike" is "I'm badly single".
