### English

I wish I was in the land of cotton.  
Old times there are not forgotten.  
Look away!, look away!, look away Dixie land.  
In Dixie land where I was born, early on one frosty mornin'  
Look away!, look away!, look away Dixie land.  
And I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!  
In Dixie land I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie.  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie. Away, away, away down south in Dixie!

o lukin tawa!, o lukin tawa!, o lukin tawa ma Tesi.  \

### Retro-Translation Back to English

I want to be in the land of clothe-plant.  
Its people understand past times.  
Look toward!, look toward!, look toward Dixie.  
On a cold Dixie day, I came to exist.  
Look toward!, look toward!, look toward Dixie.  
I want to be in Dixie. Yay! Yay!  
In Dixie I fight. I live and die in Dixie.  
Away, away, away in Dixie. Away, away, away in Dixie.
