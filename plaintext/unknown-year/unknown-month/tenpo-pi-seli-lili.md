tenpo lete li pini.  \
tenpo pi seli lili  \
li lon ni, li lon ni.  \
o lukin e kasi kule!  \
o kute e kalama waso!  \
o pilin e kon!  \
pona ale li lon  \
insa pi tenpo ni.

# Springtime

Winter has now ended,
And the Spring has wended,
To this world, to this world.
Gaze upon the cherry blossoms!
Listen to the birdsong!
Feel the calm breeze!
For every good deed,
Exists here in Spring.
