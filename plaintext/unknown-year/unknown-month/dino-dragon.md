There's a big (land) dinosaur  
It wants to be high in the sky, BUT it can't fly :(  
It's a land dinoâ€¦  
It tries to fly but is unable  
It then sees A DRAGON!!!  
The dino speaks this:  
"flying dragon, Can you take me to soar?  
I wanna be in the skies"  
The dragon says this:  
"I CAN! Come along"  
The flying dragon picks up the ground dino  
The dragon and dino soar through the skies and the dino is very satisfied!  
The end
