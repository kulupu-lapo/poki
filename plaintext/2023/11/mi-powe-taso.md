title: mi powe taso ("I'm just a fake") Dark Wave song in toki pona
description: |
  A goth toki pona song with a bit of self deprecation. Some guitar to complement the usual synth.
  
  Lyrics, in toki pona, English and French available as subtitles. Note that the translations are only a quick approximation, close to litteral, but some sentences can have several different meanings. Even the title could be translated as "I'm only lying", "I'm just wrong", so maybe I don't really have such a low self-esteem after all!
  
  "powe" is a rare toki pona word, not in the official book, but pre-dating it and surviving in some places (it's in the official dictionary, though).
  
  Lyrics written in Le Vostok, my favorite bar in La Chaux-de-Fonds.
