kon nasa la  \
lawa sina   \
li lukin sama suno lon ni  \
mi nasa la   \
mi ken ala  \
pini e wile olin  \
this crazy smoke in me  \
got me thinking we  \
could pack up everything and just leave  \
anywhere we want  \
we could be reborn  \
whatcha say now do you trust me

or is it just the kon nasa

olin  \
seme li ni  \
kon kasi li  \
ante ali  \
a mi wile   \
ala pini  \
e pilin ni  \
o awen lon ni

sina tawa la  \
mi awen pilin nasa a  \
taso nasa ni li nasa pona ala a  \
i'll be tweakin tweakin  \
all week and please I'm knee deep  \
there's be no sleep either

and I still don't know if it's just all this kon nasa  \
but i feel like this is something that should never stop  \
o kama a  \
mi kalama nasa  \
tan ala la mi tawa

kon nasa la  \
lawa sina   \
li lukin sama pi open sin  \
mi nasa la   \
mi ken ala  \
pini e wile olin  \
this crazy smoke in me  \
got me thinking we  \
could pack up all our shit and just leave  \
anywhere we want  \
we could be reborn  \
whatcha say now do you trust me

or is it just the kon nasa

ooh oooh  \
ooh ooh

ona li tawa  \
sama waso  \
I guess that was  \
kon nasa taso
