title: tenpo lili li lili seme?
description: |
  Toki Pona song in memory of Nex Benedict, a wonderful non-binary 16-years-old student assaulted in their school's bathroom on February 7, 2024 after years of bullying due to their gender identity. They died the next day.
  
  The song uses a non-traditional scale (the C Symmetrical Augmented Scale) which allows some chords to fit in both their major and minor versions. It's kind of a non-binary scale, you might say. The tempo is 119 bpm (911 backwards), and the whole thing's just under 2 minutes (similar to the assault's duration)
  
  Big thanks to soko Miselija for its poem as the basis of the lyrics, for the cover artwork and for lending me its voice.
