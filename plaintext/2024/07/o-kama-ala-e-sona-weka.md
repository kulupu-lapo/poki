> A translation of [Don't Forget](https://archiveofourown.org/external_works/1356046) by Toby Fox, Laura Shigihara
>
> I tried to make a singable version here, not a literal translation :)
>
> Notes on singing:
>
> - The first syllable in "pimeja" is sung half a beat before the first "and" starts in the original song.
> - The "(taso...)" is sort of whispered/spoken in a soft voice in the time gap between the first and second verses.
> - For "toki lon", you can either treat the final *n* as a separate syllable or just extend the *o* in lon.

suno li kama lili  
pimeja li kama suli  
ma pi sina sona li  
lon nasin weka

(taso...)

suno lili li pana  
tan insa pilin sina  
o kute!  
e toki lon ni

mi lon la,  
sina taso ala...
