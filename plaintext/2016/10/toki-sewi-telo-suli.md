title: Toki Sewi Telo Suli (Prayer to the Ocean)
description: |
  My first music video for my song in Toki Pona (new hybrid language of only 100 words created by Sonya Lang)
  The lyrics evokes our conflicted relationship with the ocean, providing for us, and yet mother of mysteries yet to be solved that intrigues and frightens human kind.
  I wrote the lyrics, (well, a sort of mantra) in my sleep while on a boat. The repetitive movement of the waves must have created a rhythm, and the music just appeared to me in my dream. First time I composed this way, it was an amazing experience, almost spiritual!
