Rafiki: ni li seme? aaa. kon sewi li nasa a!

Mufasa: Yeah, looks like the winds are changing.

Rafiki: a. ante li pona

Mufasa: Yeah, but it's not easy.  \
I know what I have to do.  \
But going back means I'll have to face my past.  \
I've been running from it for so long.

(Rafiki whacks Mufasa with a stick)

Mufasa: Ow! Jeeze, what was that for?

Rafiki: ala! ni li lon tenpo pini.

Mufasa: Yeah, but it still hurts.

Rafiki: tenpo pini li ken ike.  \

Mufasa: First...

Rafiki: ala! ni li palisa ala.
