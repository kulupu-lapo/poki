English translation:***

The sun is in its sky
a woman's hand in my hand
feeling good.
The bicycle rolls on
feeling so great because that's
strong love.

Oh sweet woman
listen to me
I want to see a woman's face
and feel the burning skin.
Oh little star
lead me
I want to know everything about you
and sleep by your side.

Red hair, blue eye,
white skin, that's my woman
a bird's colors.
She's a good friend
only she can make me real
really she's the only one.

Oh sweet woman
listen to me
I want to see a woman's face
and feel the burning skin.
Oh little star
lead me
I want to know everything about you
and sleep by your side.

Oh sweet woman...
Oh little star...
Really she's the only one...
