(Jan pona, pona, pona, pona)

I think we met in 2017  \
We were young, staying up  \
Thinking 'bout what we would be  \
And you always stuck to your philosophies  \
Talk to me, show me things  \
I had never even seen  \
A language with 130 words  \
Give or take, you were saying  \
I was sure it was a prank  \
But one day you just turned to mе and said  \
"It's no secret that Toki Pona is my favorite languagе"

jan pona, pona, pona  \

Happy anniversary, Toki Pona  \
You mean the world to me!

Eventually I got pretty good  \
Everything that was said in VC I understood  \
And doodling the symbols in my book  \
Was the way that I got through the toughest days of school  \
I wouldn't self-identify as "cool"  \
But at lunch, I was cool, 'cause I was talking to you  \
All these languages and everything you knew  \
All these epiglottal trills that you could do  \
All these inventories you knew through and through  \
All these little bits of trivia you had  \
You're the smartest person that I ever met  \
And all I ever needed was a friend
