jan seme li pona? that’s for you to decide  \
sina wile e wawa sewi, but there’s nothing to find  \
sina pana e kili lon tenpo pi jan lili  \
try to run from yourself, but there’s nowhere to hide  \
and there’s nothing to do, when you look for the words  \
to describe how it feels, they mean nothing to you  \
sina alasa e nimi e wile sitelen  \
with your head in your hands, you’ve been here  \
too many times to count in the past few months  \
sina awen alasa, but it’s just too much  \
you can feel it in your stomach, insa li ike a!  \
sina pakala a! tenpo li sike  \
tenpo ni la something’s gotta be different  \
you just gotta want it enough, gotta need it enough  \
sina wile jan seme, jan seme

jan seme, jan seme, jan seme, jan seme  \
jan seme li pona? I don’t know anymore  \
me and my jan pona, we don’t talk anymore  \
to be honest, I don’t even know why anymore  \
when I smoke, I don’t even get high anymore  \
when I don’t, I can’t sleep a whole night anymore  \
lawa mi li monsuta, I keep my eyes open  \
but I’m tired, I don’t know if I can fight anymore  \
ma Sikako la, pana sewi li ike  \
tenpo li suli, tenpo li sike, seli o kama tawa ni a!  \
I’m peeking out my window at a different season  \
dad got cancer in his throat, that’s a tough one to swallow like chicken unseasoned  \
I don’t know what the fuck’s going on anymore, kon sewi o, give me one reason

sina sona e ni: sina ken come over if you want  \
grab a pillow, we can chill, or I’ve got paper, we can draw  \
sina sona e ni: sina p-pona, like anytime  \
don’t you know you saved my life? it’s okay, nothing’s wrong  \
sina o, sona e ni: sina pona tawa mi  \
even when we butt our heads and even if we disagree  \
sina sona e ni: when I think about it I could cry  \
I know things will be alright if you’re here, it’s all I need

if you’re alright it’s all I need  \
turn off the lights and we can sleep  \
o pana sona tawa mi  \
o toki pona tawa mi  \
if you’re alright it’s all I need  \
turn off the lights and we can sleep  \
o pana sona tawa mi  \
o toki pona tawa mi
