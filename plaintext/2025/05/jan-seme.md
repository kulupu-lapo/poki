jan seme li pona? that’s for you to decide
sina wile e wawa sewi, but there’s nothing to find
sina pana e kili lon tenpo pi jan lili
try to run from yourself, but there’s nowhere to hide
and there’s nothing to do, when you look for the words
to describe how it feels, they mean nothing to you
sina alasa e nimi e wile sitelen
with your head in your hands, you’ve been here
too many times to count in the past few months
sina awen alasa, but it’s just too much
you can feel it in your stomach, insa li ike a!
sina pakala a! tenpo li sike
tenpo ni la something’s gotta be different
you just gotta want it enough, gotta need it enough
sina wile jan seme, jan seme

jan seme, jan seme, jan seme, jan seme
jan seme li pona? I don’t know anymore
me and my jan pona, we don’t talk anymore
to be honest, I don’t even know why anymore
when I smoke, I don’t even get high anymore
when I don’t, I can’t sleep a whole night anymore
lawa mi li monsuta, I keep my eyes open
but I’m tired, I don’t know if I can fight anymore
ma Sikako la, pana sewi li ike
tenpo li suli, tenpo li sike, seli o kama tawa ni a!
I’m peeking out my window at a different season
dad got cancer in his throat, that’s a tough one to swallow like chicken unseasoned
I don’t know what the fuck’s going on anymore, kon sewi o, give me one reason

sina sona e ni: sina ken come over if you want
grab a pillow, we can chill, or I’ve got paper, we can draw
sina sona e ni: sina p-pona, like anytime
don’t you know you saved my life? it’s okay, nothing’s wrong
sina o, sona e ni: sina pona tawa mi
even when we butt our heads and even if we disagree
sina sona e ni: when I think about it I could cry
I know things will be alright if you’re here, it’s all I need

if you’re alright it’s all I need
turn off the lights and we can sleep
o pana sona tawa mi
o toki pona tawa mi
if you’re alright it’s all I need
turn off the lights and we can sleep
o pana sona tawa mi
o toki pona tawa mi
