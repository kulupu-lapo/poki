monsuta mi la ona li moli e mi  \
mi wile toki e ni  \
olin ni, open olin ni  \
kon sewi o, pana sona e ni:  \
mi wile sona e ni:  \
kepeken nasin seme la  \
mi awen ken ala toki ni?  \
tenpo sike lete la, sina sitelen e ijo  \
sina pana e ni tawa mi, pona tawa sina, a a a  \
tenpo ni la, mi pakala pini  \
mi toki lon la, mi wile e olin sina

I’d like to think that I love every letter just as equally  \
but I’ve been putting U and I together extra frequently  \
Just a couple questions have been eating me alive  \
Are you shooting me those eyes, or, are mine deceiving me?  \
Last night was a movie, baby, can we get a sequel please?  \
And can you save a seat? ‘Cause next to you is where I need to be  \
Stomach full of butterflies, I don’t have an appetite  \
mi ken ala pakala. taso, mi wile toki e ni:  \
You and I’s a passing thought of mine that I cannot deny  \
but something in me says it’s chemistry, it isn’t rocket science  \
Pencil in whenever, and we can do whatever  \
You can name whoever, guarantee that we could do it better  \
pana sewi ike, pilin pona in whatever weather  \
toki lon ni: kama sona sina mi, li wile nasin ni:  \
I’ll, get a hundred pens and fill a hundred pages  \
write as many letters as it takes to get to know you, baby

monsuta mi la ona li moli e mi  \
mi wile toki e ni  \
olin ni, open olin ni  \
kon sewi o, pana sona e ni:  \
mi wile sona e ni:  \
kepeken nasin seme la  \
mi awen ken ala toki ni?  \
tenpo sike lete la, sina sitelen e ijo  \
sina pana e ni tawa mi, pona tawa sina, a a a  \
tenpo ni la, mi pakala pini  \
mi toki lon la, mi wile e olin sina

tenpo ni li waso, tenpo ni li sike  \
sina lon ni ala la tenpo ni li ike  \
weka tan ona, la mi a sona  \
mi ken olin e sina kepeken toki pona  \
where will we be going? baby I propose this:  \
crystal clear water, into which we could toe dip  \
distant mountains, up, down, bouncing  \
and you could pick ‘em out with your fingers like they're clouds or something  \
you described, it’s what you’re fantasizing when you pass the time  \
the thought of getting back on track with you’s what keeps my back aligned  \
and back in time is where a half a mind of mine is active on the day-to-day  \
I've got your radio waves to keep my brain awake  \
and I can't wait to share a rainy day without a passing thought of data rates or how to schedule, a train station date  \
I got another letter from you, said you made it recently  \
I hope you make it soon, I’d love to see you, baby  \
weka tan a

monsuta mi la ona li moli e mi  \
