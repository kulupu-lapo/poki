<!-- I have been slow to post examples of sitelen sitelen here that have been sent to me, and I’m hoping to change that, because I’ve seen a lot of great examples lately. Here’s one I really enjoyed. It’s the Ave Maria by Tobias Merkle. I especially like the extra circles in the sewi, opening and closing like [Takashi Murakami eyes](https://www.artsy.net/collection/takashi-murakami-jellyfish-eyes). -->

jan Meli o, kon sewi li suli insa sina. 

wan sewi li poka sina.

lon meli ma la, wan sewi li pona e sina. 

kili pona pi insa sina li jan sewi Jesu.

jan Meli sewi o! mama pi jan sewi o!

lon tenpo ni la, lon tenpo pi moli mi suli la, o toki tawa wan sewi lon mi mute jan ike.
