mi lape a. ni li pini a.  
mi open e oko. taso mi ken ala lukin e sina.  
mi pakala. tenpo ni li seme?  
noka mi li ike. taso mi tawa kepeken wawa mi ale.  
pilin mi li tawa suli tawa sina kepeken tenpo lili.

<!-- (I slept a lot, and it finally ended. I open my eyes, but cannot look at you. I'm bad! What's the time now? My legs are poor, but I move using all my strength. My heart moves quickly to you in a short time.) -->

linja lawa sina en oko sina li tawa wawa lon pilin mi.  
mi wile pilin e kon pi poka sina lon tenpo kama ale mi.  
kalama sina li sama jan suli mi pi tenpo pini.  
mi kama sona ala e ni: mi wile toki e seme?

<!-- (Your hair and your eyes move fiercely in my heart. I want to feel the air around you for the rest of my life. Your voice sounds like the important person to me in the past. I've turned to be not knowing what I should say.) -->

tenpo pini mute mute mute la  
mi wile alasa e nimi sina.  
mi pilin e pona pi sinpin musi sina lon nasin la  
mi sona tawa.

<!-- (Long long long ago, I wanted to hunt for your name. When I was on the way, thinking of the kindness of your smiling face, I knew how and where to go.) -->

ike la sina ale ale ale li  
ken kama moli lon lawa mi.  
taso mi pakala ala.  
tenpo wan sin la mi open e alasa.  
mi alasa tan tenpo open pi ale ni la  
mi ken tawa ma sina.

<!-- (In the worst situation, all of all of all of you can become extinct in my mind. But I would not be disheartened. Once again, I would start hunting. If I hunt from the very beginning of this universe, I would be able to reach your homeland.) -->

----------

tenpo open la sina lape.  
mi sitelen e ni tawa sina kepeken nasin seme?  
mun mute en sewi mute  
la mi tawa sina li ken toki ale e tenpo pini.   
tenpo ni la sijelo sina li kama lon oko mi.

<!-- (At the very start, you were sleeping. How can I describe that to you? Through many stars and many skies, I reached you and could talk all about the past. Now your body finally appears in my eyes.) -->

sina sona ala e ni: sina ante li lon li musi tawa mi.  
sina pilin ike la mi wile e ni: olin mi li pona e ni.   
suli a li nasin walo pi kon sewi pimeja.  
kepeken ni la mi pana e luka mi tawa luka sina.

<!-- (You did not know that another you existed and was delightful to me. When you feel sad I wish that my love can make it better. So grand is the milky way in the dark sky! Moving through it all along, I reach my hand toward yours.) -->

tenpo pini mute mute mute la  
mi wile alasa e nimi sina.  
mi pilin e kalama pi toki en telo oko sina la  
mi sona tawa.

<!-- (Long long long ago, I wanted to hunt for your name. When I thought of the sound of your words and tears, I knew how and where to go.) -->

tenpo pimeja pi open utala  
la ala li ken pini e mi tu.  
mi o pali e sitelen pi pilin sina  
lon sitelen pi nasin ma.  
sina kama e ni tawa mi:  
nasin pi pini wile li kama lon ala.

<!-- (On the night of a fight's start, nothing can stop us. I'ma draw a mark of your heart on the road map. You've made this happen to me: the way to give up the wish no longer exists.) -->

----------

tenpo pini mute mute la  
mi wile alasa e nimi sina.  
mi pilin e pona pi sinpin musi sina lon nasin la  
mi sona tawa.

<!-- (Long long ago, I wanted to hunt for your name. When I was on the way, thinking of the kindness of your smiling face, I knew how and where to go.) -->

ike la sina ale ale ale li   
ken kama moli lon lawa mi.  
taso mi pakala ala.  
tenpo wan sin la mi open e alasa.  
kalama musi ni la  
mi tawa sama linja suno lon tenpo mute a.

<!-- (In the worst situation, all of all of all of you can become extinct in my mind. But I would not be disheartened. Once again, I would start hunting. With this song, I would travel like the light ray for a lot of time!) -->
