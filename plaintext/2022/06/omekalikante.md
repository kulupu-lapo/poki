  Happy birthday omekalike!
  
  I've been saving this remix up for quite a while, tweaking it and adding new elements over the course of like months. Two days ago I made a mad dash to write the lyrics (both in English and in Toki Pona, don't freak out!), yesterday I recorded and edited them, and today here we are ^^
  
  The drums, sfx, main vocals, and text-to-speech are all new additions on the track, but everything else was made using vocal clips from the original omekalike.
  
  Much love to all y'all. I'm still very much blown away by, like, all of what's happened with my music this year. This is not at all where I thought rejoining ma pona was going to lead me, but I'm so glad it did. sina ale li pona sewi a.

(Ceci n'est pas une guitar  \
ni li kalama uta)

I been in the game for a year now  \
Took a lil while, but I'm here now  \
Showed 'em what I had, they said it warranted a badge  \
Why the hell did I think it wasn't clear how  \
Now I'm coming back on the mic  \
The studio one, that's right  \
Out from the dorm, back in the home, bass with the amp simulator on the vox, automating the delay time

I'm making bank in a business they ain't even heard of  \
I only stumble over my words  \
Tryna explain just half of a third of  \
what kinda world I'm living in terms of  \
Now even they want me to get the word out  \
137, to be unexact  \
They think it's crazy I made that work out

Brains getting blurred out  \
'Cause on top of the lyricism, yeah I made the beats hit  \
Top of the line before they're even completed  \
Go ahead with the tuner, boy, I don't even need it  \
And on top of the quality, I stay friendly to speak with  \
Don't care if I blow up, that's how I intend to keep it  \
If I'm being real I still don't fully believe this  \
But Jesus 

Would be a good rhyme if I said the name that way so I gotta go meta  \
Hardly would be my song if I didn't  \
I know the way I write and I woulda dodged that shit if I didn't know better  \
but y'all love me and I don't dodge evidence  \
I'm too busy here setting precedents  \
Getting a bit excessive like

pali nasa  \
mi wile e mani la  \
mi ken kalama suli e nimi sama "wawa" sama "pipi" sama "mama"  \
mama mi li ken kute e ni  \
nasin pi jan mute la mi nasa taso ala   \
(sina pilin monsuta ala monsuta?)

taso mani li kama tawa mi  \
toki sewi li kama tawa mi  \
sona mute li kama tawa mi  \
ijo ni li pona tawa mi  \
lukin mi la mi ken monsuta  \
tenpo pini la ken ni li lon ala  \
(a a a, musi aâ€”sina o pilin monsuta)
