(Ceci n'est pas une guitar  \
ni li kalama uta)

I been in the game for a year now  \
Took a lil while, but I'm here now  \
Showed 'em what I had, they said it warranted a badge  \
Why the hell did I think it wasn't clear how  \
Now I'm coming back on the mic  \
The studio one, that's right  \
Out from the dorm, back in the home, bass with the amp simulator on the vox, automating the delay time

I'm making bank in a business they ain't even heard of  \
I only stumble over my words  \
Tryna explain just half of a third of  \
what kinda world I'm living in terms of  \
Now even they want me to get the word out  \
137, to be unexact  \
They think it's crazy I made that work out

Brains getting blurred out  \
'Cause on top of the lyricism, yeah I made the beats hit  \
Top of the line before they're even completed  \
Go ahead with the tuner, boy, I don't even need it  \
And on top of the quality, I stay friendly to speak with  \
Don't care if I blow up, that's how I intend to keep it  \
If I'm being real I still don't fully believe this  \
But Jesus 

Would be a good rhyme if I said the name that way so I gotta go meta  \
Hardly would be my song if I didn't  \
I know the way I write and I woulda dodged that shit if I didn't know better  \
but y'all love me and I don't dodge evidence  \
I'm too busy here setting precedents  \
Getting a bit excessive like

pali nasa  \
mi wile e mani la  \
mi ken kalama suli e nimi sama "wawa" sama "pipi" sama "mama"  \
mama mi li ken kute e ni  \
nasin pi jan mute la mi nasa taso ala   \

(I still haven't brushed my teeth yet, I should probably do that)
